Task no.1 - API Test for page: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

Unfortunately I finished this task partially.

Done:
1. Write test (using any library eg. rest assured) that will call 
GET	on /comments endpoint and will assert the response code and will assert that number of comments is greater than 0 
assert that body has comment with email: "Jayne_Kuhic@sydney.com"

2. Write POJO class named 'Comment' that will represent the post from the previous exercise.
